Working on adding in the magic 8 ball project

This project helps see the utilization of javascript in action.  Each time the ball is "shaken" it utilizes Javascript.
The project is a great demonstration of a vareity of languages and skills that work together to accomplish a common goal.
Simply open the project on a website - ask it a question and shake.  The answer will come to you!
Any and all questions can be sent directly to me!  I love hearing from people!
I maintain the project but am open to suggestions from all collaborators.
